# RECODING YOUR VITALITY

## Subheadline

We build research platforms around endogenous lipid signaling, designing systems that support motivation, routine, and sustained training behavior.

## Section Title

### THE FUTURE OF ENDOGENOUS LIPID SIGNALING

## Description

Beyond selling supplements, we study how lipid-mediated signaling systems interact with physical activity. Our work focuses on designing environments where exercise itself becomes the trigger for motivation.

# Core Concept

## CORE CONCEPT (이 회사의 차별점)

### Exercise Is the Switch

We focus on lipid mediators that interact with exercise-induced signaling, including pathways associated with blood–brain barrier accessibility.

Rather than mimicking stimulation, our research explores how physical activity itself activates endogenous systems related to motivation, engagement, and reward.

> Motivation is not added.  
> It is unlocked by movement.

## SCIENCE PAGE (상세페이지 - 고정 개념)

### What are NAEs?

N-acylethanolamides (NAEs) are endogenous lipid signaling molecules naturally produced in the human body. They participate in peripheral and central pathways related to energy balance, inflammatory signaling, and neural engagement.

### Why exercise matters

Many NAE-related pathways become most relevant during and after physical activity. We study NAEs in the context of movement-triggered signaling, not passive consumption.

Ongoing findings are published separately in Research Updates.

## Peripheral NAE Platform (상세 페이지)

상세 페이지 (개념 고정 + 내용은 업데이트)

- Scope: Daily baseline · Routine stability · Peripheral signaling

### Overview

This platform integrates OEA, PEA, and SEA as a system, not isolated ingredients. Each component contributes to a different peripheral context, together supporting the conditions required for consistent training behavior.

### Included Research Concepts

- OEA — metabolic and satiety-related signaling associated with energy balance
- PEA — inflammation-associated signaling pathways linked to physical comfort
- SEA — a saturated, oxidation-stable NAE associated with baseline lipid signaling

> This is not a stimulant stack.  
> It is a peripheral signaling environment.

## Central NAE Research (상세 페이지)

상세 페이지 (연구 업데이트 중심)

- Scope: Motivation · Reward · Cognitive engagement

### Overview

This research track focuses on DHEA (Synaptamide) and AEA (Anandamide)—lipid mediators associated with blood–brain barrier accessibility and exercise-related neural signaling.

Rather than targeting these pathways directly, we study how physical activity itself acts as the primary trigger for endogenous motivation-related signaling.

### Active Research Areas

- **DHEA (Synaptamide)**
  - Neural signaling related to learning and synaptic plasticity
  - Cognitive engagement in the context of sustained physical activity
- **AEA (Anandamide)**
  - Endocannabinoid-associated pathways (CB1 / CB2)
  - Exercise-induced motivational and affective states
  - Neurochemical responses to endurance activity

Central NAE research is conducted with strict boundaries, emphasizing safety, evidence, and biological context.
