# Project Rules

## Directory Structure (Priority Order)
The project follows a structured directory organization with the following priority:

1. **@01_data**: Data files - only added by user
   - Contains data files, database structures, and user-provided data
   - Files in this directory should not be modified by automated processes

2. **@02_log**: Job logging (Mandatory)
   - All jobs and tasks must be documented as markdown files in this directory
   - Contains job logs(`02_log/02_job/`) and chat(`02_log/01_chat/`) logs
   - Job logs are historical records of completed work

3. **@03_script**: Program code
   - Contains executable scripts and automation tools
   - All program code and executable files should be placed here

4. **@04_layout**: Blueprint documents of this project
   - Contains design documents, architecture blueprints, and structural plans
   - Layout represents confirmed plans (finalized blueprints)

5. **@05_plan**: Plan for building or updating script or layout
   - Contains planning documents for building or updating scripts or layouts
   - Plans are under consideration (not yet finalized)
   - Plans, checklists, and future steps should be documented in `plan_*.md` files in this directory

6. **@06_docs**: Other docs with markdown format
   - All project documentation in markdown format
   - General documentation and reference materials

## Language Requirements (Mandatory)
- All structured data and their names must be in English
- All code and comments must be written in English
- Database schema, table names, column names, and all identifiers must be in English
- **Documentation Language**: All documentation files (markdown files in `02_log/`, `04_layout/`, `05_plan/`, `06_docs/`) must be written in Korean
- Code-related documentation (inline comments, code documentation) should remain in English
- Project documentation (plans, layouts, job logs, general docs) should be written in Korean

## Job Logging (**Mandatory**)
- All jobs and tasks must be documented as markdown files in the `02_log/02_job/` directory
- Each job should be tracked with appropriate markdown documentation
- Job logs should include relevant details such as task description, implementation steps, and outcomes
- Job logs are historical records of completed work - they should NOT contain plans, checklists, or future steps
- Plans, checklists, and future steps should be documented in `plan_*.md` files in the `05_plan/` directory

## Chat Log Usage
- The `02_log/01_chat/` directory is used by the user
- Users may make requests for referencing chat logs
- Chat logs serve as a communication history and reference point

## Installation and Dependencies
- You can ask the user about installation requirements
- Detour methods (workarounds) should be considered as a second option
- When installation is needed, prefer asking the user first before implementing alternative solutions

## Virtual Environment (venv)
- The project uses a Python virtual environment located in the `venv/` directory
- Always activate the virtual environment before running Python scripts or installing packages
- To activate: `source venv/bin/activate` (Linux/Mac) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- Install all Python dependencies within the virtual environment
- Include `venv/` in `.gitignore` if version control is used
- When creating or modifying Python scripts, ensure they are compatible with the virtual environment

## Script Directory
- The `03_script/` directory contains executable scripts and automation tools
- Scripts should be well-documented with clear purpose and usage instructions
- Follow consistent naming conventions for script files
- Scripts should be executable and include proper shebang lines when applicable
- All scripts must follow the project's language requirements (English for code and comments)
- Scripts related to database operations should follow PostgreSQL best practices

## Documentation
- All project documentation should be placed in the `06_docs/` directory
- Documentation files should be in markdown format (.md) unless otherwise specified

## General Guidelines
- Follow PostgreSQL best practices for database design
- Maintain consistency in naming conventions
- Keep code and documentation organized and well-structured
- Ensure all database schemas and structures are properly documented

## Indexing
- All files in same folder should have intger index prefixed name.

## Date and Datetime Format (**Mandatory**)
- **ALL dates MUST include time information (HHMMSS)** - time information is mandatory and cannot be omitted
- All dates must be written in datetime format: YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS
- The time component (HHMMSS) is **REQUIRED** and must always be present
- **DO NOT** use dates without time information (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD is invalid)
- **DO NOT** use placeholder times like 000000 unless it is actually midnight (00:00:00)
- When creating or updating documents, always use the actual time when the work was performed
- Example: 2025-12-30T010101 (December 30, 2025 at 01:01:01)
- Example: 2024-12-22T113854 (December 22, 2024 at 11:38:54)
- Example: 2024-12-22T000000 (December 22, 2024 at 00:00:00) - only valid if work was actually done at midnight
- Use 24-hour format for time (HHMMSS)
- Leading zeros must be included for single-digit values
- When in doubt, use the current time or the actual time when the work was completed

## Number Notation with Base (**Mandatory**)
- **ALL numbers MUST explicitly indicate their base (radix)** - base notation is mandatory and cannot be omitted
- When writing numbers in documentation, always specify the base using standard notation:
  - **Decimal (base 10)**: Use suffix `_10` or prefix `(dec)` or explicitly state "decimal" or "base 10"
  - **Hexadecimal (base 16)**: Use prefix `0x` or suffix `_16` or explicitly state "hex" or "base 16"
  - **Binary (base 2)**: Use prefix `0b` or suffix `_2` or explicitly state "binary" or "base 2"
  - **Octal (base 8)**: Use prefix `0o` or suffix `_8` or explicitly state "octal" or "base 8"
- **Examples**:
  - Correct: `0x79BE667E` (hex), `508_10` (decimal), `0b1010` (binary)
  - Correct: `79BE667E (hex)` or `79BE667E (base 16)`
  - Incorrect: `79BE667E` (no base indication), `508` (no base indication for non-obvious decimal)
- **Exceptions**:
  - Date/time values (YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS format) are always decimal (base 10) and do not require explicit notation
  - File index numbers (e.g., `01_`, `02_`) are always decimal (base 10) and do not require explicit notation
  - Simple counting numbers in narrative text (e.g., "3 files", "10 values") are always decimal (base 10) and do not require explicit notation
  - Cryptographic keys, hash values, and addresses should ALWAYS specify base (typically hexadecimal)
  - Large numbers that could be ambiguous should always specify base
- When in doubt, always specify the base explicitly
